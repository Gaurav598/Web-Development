🌐 Web Development Course

This repository contains my complete Web Development learning journey. The course is divided into Frontend and Backend, covering both MERN Stack and Spring Boot to provide a full understanding of modern web development.

📌 Features

✅ Frontend Development – Completed with modern tools and libraries.

✅ Backend Development – Implemented in two different stacks:

MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

Spring Boot (Java-based backend framework)

✅ Hands-on projects included for practice and real-world application.

🖥️ Frontend (Completed)

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Responsive Design with Flexbox, Grid, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap

React.js – Components, Hooks, State Management, Routing, API handling

Animations & Interactivity

⚙️ Backend (Completed)
1. MERN Stack

MongoDB – NoSQL Database

Express.js – Backend framework for Node.js

React.js – Frontend integration

Node.js – Server-side JavaScript runtime

REST APIs & CRUD Operations

2. Spring Boot

Java-based backend framework

RESTful APIs

Database integration with JPA/Hibernate

Authentication & Security

📂 Tech Stacks Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS

Backend (MERN): Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React.js

Backend (Spring Boot): Java, Spring Framework, Hibernate/JPA, MySQL/PostgreSQL

🚀 Projects Built in This Course

Frontend Projects (UI-focused)

MERN Stack Projects (Full-stack apps with MongoDB + Node.js + Express + React)

Spring Boot Projects (Enterprise-level backend apps with Java + MySQL/PostgreSQL)

🎯 Goal of This Course

To master full-stack web development by building scalable, responsive, and production-ready applications using both JavaScript-based (MERN) and Java-based (Spring Boot) stacks.

📜 Future Plans

🔹 Deploy projects on Netlify, Vercel, and Render

🔹 Add Docker & Kubernetes for containerization and deployment

🔹 Explore Microservices with Spring Boot
